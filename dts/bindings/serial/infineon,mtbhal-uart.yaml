        PORT pin configuration for TX, RX, RTS, CTS signals.
        We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes These
        nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
        defines and be of the form p<port>_<pin><peripheral inst>_<signal>.

        Examples
           use TX, RX
           pinctrl-0 = <&p5_1_scb5_uart_tx &p5_0_scb5_uart_rx>;

           use RX only
           pinctrl-0 = <&p5_0_scb5_uart_rx>;

           use TX, RX, RTS, CTS
           pinctrl-0 = <&p3_1_scb2_uart_tx &p3_0_scb2_uart_rx &p3_2_scb2_uart_rts &p3_3_scb2_uart_cts>;
